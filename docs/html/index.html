            <h2> What is BitToll? </h2>
            <p>
            BitToll is a different way to use Bitcoins. Rather than sending transactions over the network, you request payments on a Bittoll server. The server maintains balances and allows transactions to occur as fast as it can generally within 200ms. There are multiple ways to deposit Bitcoins inside of the Bittoll server, both mining and by sending them via the Bitcoin network.
            </p>
            <h2> Whats the point?</h2>
            <p>
            Bitcoins are a very interesting currency, however they are much too slow to be used for automated transactions, such as charging for a website load, or paying 1 cent per email. Bittoll was created to resolve this problem and make it easy to use Bitcoins in an automated manner.
            </p>

            <h2> What features does Bittoll have?</h2>
            <p>
            Bittoll lets you deposit Bitcoins into the node via a normal Bitcoin transaction. It also lets you deposit into the node via mining. It lets you create payments to be fulfilled, check whether they have been fulfilled, and to pay an outstanding payment. It also allows you to withdraw your money into the Bitcoin network.
            </p>

            <h2> How do I start using it? </h2>
            <p>
            Each Bittoll node is a set of servers that are communicated with via HTTP API calls. For more details visit our <a href="/api">API Documentation </a>
            </p>

            <h2> Current limitations & advice </h2>
            <p>
            Most obviously the current setup doesn't scale very well. The frontend webservers scale but the rest of it cannot. This is on the TODO list. More crucially but less obviously the current backup system can lose up to an hour of data. I am working on writing a custom backup system which backs up at a much higher level of granularity. There are also most likely security holes that I have not spotted. The server configs(along with everything else) are in the <a href="http://github.com/c00w/BitToll"> git repository </a> which I encourage you to investigate before entrusting BitToll with large amounts of bitcoins.
            </p>
