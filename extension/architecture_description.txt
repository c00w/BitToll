The extension shall be split into the following parts:
	-a content script that will check webpages for an item in the head 
		saying that they want bittoll payments, 
		and insert info back into the head once the payment is made
	-various popup windows that will ask the user to verfy actions, handle logins, etc.
	-a persistent background page that will handle the actual payments and shit
